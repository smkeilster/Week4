# Missing-Comments
Commenting code exercise.

You have been hired by a small development company to finish
a game titled "Lost Library of Socrates." The developer that left
before you was inconsiderate and did not comment any of his code.
You need to figure out what this program does and add comments to
help you in the future.

In this exercise you will work through the empty comment sections
and describe the purpose of each portion of the code.
Do this for index.html, socrates.js, and socrates.css.
Add comments to all sections that have an empty /* */, //, or \<!-- -->.

There is no collaboration for the first hour.

Good luck!
