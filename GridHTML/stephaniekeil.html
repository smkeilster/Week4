<p class=subhead>A Story from the <i>Star Tribune</i></p>
<textarea style="color:#006622;" rows="4" cols="100">
 Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson and 3M Co. are expected to make an announcement Tuesday afternoon on what was scheduled to be the opening day of a long-awaited trial over the decades-long contamination of groundwater in Washington County.
 Jury selection was scheduled to begin Tuesday, until Hennepin County District Judge Kevin Burke said there would not be a trial Tuesday. Lawyers for both sides are expected to release more information at 3:30 p.m., in what could indicate a settlement. The attorneys declined to comment.
 The stateâ€™s lawsuit claims that 3M knowingly contaminated the drinking water of several east-metro communities, causing up to $5 billion in potential damage to property values, wildlife and human health. The company has denied wrongdoing, saying it followed the law in disposing of its industrial wastes and that it settled the matter in a 2008 agreement with the state in which 3M agreed to clean up the chemicals and pay for clean drinking water in the affected communities.
 The contamination came from perfluorinated chemicals, or PFCs, that 3M dumped legally at four sites in Washington County. They have now polluted a 100 square mile plume of groundwater from Woodbury to the Mississippi River at Hastings.
